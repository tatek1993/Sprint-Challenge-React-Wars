1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

    React is a component based JS library used for building UI.

1. What does it mean to think in react?

    It's much easier to work with components. Instead of making changes to a file that can affect whole swaths of code that you might not want it to affect, we can make changes within a 
    component and see those changes go into effect in real time. This means we only have to focus on a single compnent at a time and then we can stitch them together after.

1. Describe state.

    State is used to update a compnent when an action is performed (clicking, typing, etc). 

1. Describe props.

    Props are immutable parameters used to send data to . We can't change the data of a prop.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

    A side effect is something that effects data outside the scope of the function.
